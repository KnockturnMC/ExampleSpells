ExampleSpells
===

The example spell repository contains example code for a few spell concepts and frameworks provided by the `spellcore`
project on [Knockturn Networks](https://knockturnmc.com/).

---

This repository is mainly for understanding the `spellcore` framework rather than actually using the code.
